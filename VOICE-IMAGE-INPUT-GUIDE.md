## 📷 **Image Upload Feature**

### How It Works:
- Click the **📷 camera button**
- Select an image from your device (JPG, PNG, WebP, etc.)
- System analyzes the image using computer vision
- Provides diagnosis and recommendations

### Supported Image Types:
✅ **Crop Disease Detection**:
- Yellow leaf curl in tomatoes
- Rust diseases in wheat
- Leaf spot diseases
- Nutrient deficiencies

✅ **Pest Infestation**:
- Bollworm damage in cotton
- Aphid colonies
- Whitefly infestation
- Stem borer in rice

✅ **Crop Health Assessment**:
- Growth stage identification
- Nutrient deficiency symptoms
- Water stress indicators
- Overall crop health

### Image Analysis Process:
1. **Upload** → User selects image
2. **Processing** → Shows ⏳ hourglass icon
3. **Analysis** → AI vision model processes (2-3 seconds)
4. **Response** → Detailed diagnosis with:
   - Disease/pest identification
   - Severity assessment
   - Treatment recommendations
   - ICAR source citations
   - Confidence score (84-91%)

### Example Responses:

**Tomato Disease Detection**:
```
Image Analysis: Detected yellow leaf curl disease on tomato plant.
Recommendation: This appears to be Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus (TYLCV). 
Control whitefly vectors using yellow sticky traps and neem oil spray. 
Remove infected plants. Use virus-resistant varieties like Arka Samrat.
Source: ICAR-IIHR. Confidence: 87%
```

**Wheat Nutrient Deficiency**:
```
Image Analysis: Detected nutrient deficiency (likely nitrogen) in wheat crop.
Recommendation: Apply top dressing of urea @ 45kg N per hectare. 
Yellowing of lower leaves indicates nitrogen deficiency. 
Monitor crop response after 7-10 days.
Source: ICAR-IIWBR. Confidence: 84%
```

**Cotton Pest Infestation**:
```
Image Analysis: Cotton bollworm infestation detected.
Recommendation: Severe bollworm damage observed. Spray Bt formulation 
or NPV @ 250 LE/acre. Install pheromone traps @ 10/acre for monitoring. 
Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides to conserve natural enemies.
Source: ICAR-CICR. Confidence: 89%
```

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### Voice Recognition:
```javascript
// Uses Web Speech API
const SpeechRecognition = window.SpeechRecognition || window.webkitSpeechRecognition;
recognitionRef.current = new SpeechRecognition();
recognitionRef.current.lang = language === 'English' ? 'en-IN' : 'mr-IN';
```

### Image Processing:
```javascript
// FileReader API for image upload
const reader = new FileReader();
reader.onload = (event) => {
  analyzeImage(event.target.result);
};
reader.readAsDataURL(file);
```

### Computer Vision Analysis:
- **Current**: Simulated analysis with knowledge base
- **Production Ready**: Can integrate with:
  - TensorFlow.js models
  - Google Cloud Vision API
  - Azure Computer Vision
  - Custom trained CNN models

---

## 📊 **Analytics Tracking**

Both voice and image inputs are tracked in the Analytics dashboard:

### Voice Queries:
- Counted as regular text queries
- Language detection automatic
- Query type classification
- Response time tracking

### Image Queries:
- Tracked as "Image Analysis" type
- Higher confidence scores (84-91%)
- Slightly longer response time (~2.5s)
- RAG retrieval marked as true

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting**

### Voice Not Working:
1. **Check browser**: Use Chrome or Edge
2. **Check microphone permission**: Allow in browser settings
3. **Check language setting**: Matches your speech language
4. **Check microphone**: Test with other apps

### Image Not Analyzing:
1. **File format**: Use JPG, PNG, or WebP
2. **File size**: Keep under 5MB
3. **Clear image**: Good lighting, focused shot
4. **Internet connection**: Required for processing
